/* Description:
* Given two sets of positive integers, we create a pair of disjoint sets.
* The union of these two sets must be the original set, and the sum of the
* integers in each set must equal each other.
* We shall use a genetic algorithm to determine these two sets.
*
* Input: _Precisely_ SIZE_ORIGINAL_SET (20) integers, separated by whitespace
*
* Output: The solution chromosome, and how the chromosome leads to the best
* solution it comes to.
